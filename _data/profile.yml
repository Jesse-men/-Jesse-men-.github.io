  <p>
    I work at the intersection of AI for wireless communication and immersive media rendering and transmission. I enjoy turning ideas into practical, real-time systems that are efficient and user-centric.

    Outside the lab, I keep things active and creative: I like fitness 💪 and swimming 🏊‍♀️, take photos 📷 to capture everyday stories, and unwind by cooking 🍳. Feel free to connect with me if our interests overlap.
